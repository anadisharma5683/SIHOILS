# Performance Optimization Fixes

This document explains the changes made to resolve browser console warnings related to font preloading and CSS MIME types.

## Issues Identified

1. **Font Preload Warnings**: 
   - The browser was showing warnings about preloaded WOFF2 font resources not being used within a few seconds
   - Example: `The resource https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/media/caa3a2e1cccd8315-s.p.853070df.woff2 was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event.`

2. **CSS/JS MIME Type Error**:
   - Error: `Refused to apply style from 'https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/c8d63484c312b3bd.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.`
   - Error: `Refused to execute script from 'https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/6f47d9648a939831.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.`

## Root Cause

The MIME type errors were caused by incorrect route ordering in `vercel.json`. The catch-all route `"/(.*)"` was intercepting requests for static assets before they could be served with proper MIME types. Additionally, the application structure includes various static asset directories that needed specific handling.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Font Preload Optimization

**Changes made in `src/app/layout.tsx`**:
- Disabled automatic font preloading by setting `preload: false` for both Geist fonts
- This prevents Next.js from automatically injecting preload links for fonts that may not be immediately used

**Changes made in `src/app/globals.css`**:
- Added custom `@font-face` definitions for Geist and Geist Mono fonts
- Fonts are now loaded via local files in the `public/fonts` directory
- Added `font-display: swap` for better loading performance

**Changes made in `public/fonts/`**:
- Created a dedicated directory for font files
- Copied actual WOFF2 font files from the build output to this directory
- Added a README.md to explain the font handling approach

### 2. MIME Type Fix

**Changes made in `vercel.json`**:
- Reordered routes to ensure static assets are handled before the catch-all route
- Added specific routes for different file types with proper MIME types:
  - JavaScript files: `application/javascript`
  - CSS files: `text/css`
  - Font files: `font/woff2`
- Made route patterns more specific using file extensions
- Added a pattern to handle hashed directory names in the static path
- Ensured proper cache control headers for all static assets

**Changes made in `next.config.ts`**:
- Added comprehensive header configurations for different static asset types
- Added cache control headers for chunks, css, and media files
- Added `output: 'standalone'` for better deployment optimization
- Enhanced security headers with proper Content Security Policy

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Console Warnings**: No more preload warnings or MIME type errors
2. **Better Performance**: Fonts are loaded more efficiently with proper caching
3. **Improved User Experience**: Faster rendering with font-display swap
4. **Reduced Bandwidth**: Only fonts that are actually used will be loaded
5. **Proper Asset Serving**: Static files are served with correct MIME types
6. **Enhanced Security**: Improved Content Security Policy and security headers

## How It Works

1. Next.js no longer automatically preloads Google Fonts
2. Fonts are defined with `@font-face` in CSS and loaded on-demand
3. Vercel routes are ordered to serve static files with correct MIME types before falling back to the catch-all route
4. Browser caching is optimized with appropriate cache headers
5. Security is enhanced with proper Content Security Policy headers

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Open the browser developer tools
3. Check the Console tab for any remaining warnings
4. Check the Network tab to verify:
   - Fonts are loaded correctly
   - CSS files are served with `text/css` MIME type
   - JavaScript files are served with `application/javascript` MIME type
   - All assets load without MIME type errors
5. Verify that the application functions correctly after deployment

## Future Considerations

1. Monitor font loading performance to ensure no regressions
2. Consider implementing font loading strategies for critical fonts
3. Regularly audit static assets for similar issues
4. Test the application across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior
5. Monitor Vercel analytics for any performance regressions after deployment
