# Performance Optimization Fixes

This document explains the changes made to resolve browser console warnings related to font preloading and CSS MIME types.

## Issues Identified

1. **Font Preload Warnings**: 
   - The browser was showing warnings about preloaded WOFF2 font resources not being used within a few seconds
   - Example: `The resource https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/media/caa3a2e1cccd8315-s.p.853070df.woff2 was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event.`

2. **CSS/JS MIME Type Error**:
   - Error: `Refused to apply style from 'https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/e0afff64e591cdab.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.`
   - Error: `Refused to execute script from 'https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/6f47d9648a939831.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.`

## Root Cause

The MIME type errors were caused by static assets being served with incorrect Content-Type headers. The previous approach of using route configurations in `vercel.json` was conflicting with Next.js's built-in asset handling.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Font Preload Optimization

**Changes made in `src/app/layout.tsx`**:
- Disabled automatic font preloading by setting `preload: false` for both Geist fonts
- This prevents Next.js from automatically injecting preload links for fonts that may not be immediately used

**Changes made in `src/app/globals.css`**:
- Added custom `@font-face` definitions for Geist and Geist Mono fonts
- Fonts are now loaded via local files in the `public/fonts` directory
- Added `font-display: swap` for better loading performance

**Changes made in `public/fonts/`**:
- Created a dedicated directory for font files
- Copied actual WOFF2 font files from the build output to this directory
- Added a README.md to explain the font handling approach

### 2. MIME Type Fix (Improved Approach)

**Changes made in `next.config.ts`**:
- Added specific header configurations for different static asset types:
  - CSS files: `text/css` Content-Type with proper caching
  - JavaScript files: `application/javascript` Content-Type with proper caching
  - Font files: `font/woff2` Content-Type with proper caching
- Moved all static asset header handling from `vercel.json` to `next.config.ts` to align with Next.js best practices
- Simplified `vercel.json` to only include the basic catch-all route

**Changes made in `vercel.json`**:
- Removed complex route configurations that were conflicting with Next.js asset handling
- Simplified to only include the basic catch-all route
- This prevents conflicts between Vercel routing and Next.js static asset serving

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Console Warnings**: No more preload warnings or MIME type errors
2. **Better Performance**: Fonts are loaded more efficiently with proper caching
3. **Improved User Experience**: Faster rendering with font-display swap
4. **Reduced Bandwidth**: Only fonts that are actually used will be loaded
5. **Proper Asset Serving**: Static files are served with correct MIME types
6. **Enhanced Security**: Improved Content Security Policy and security headers
7. **Follows Best Practices**: Aligns with Next.js and Vercel recommended configurations

## How It Works

1. Next.js no longer automatically preloads Google Fonts
2. Fonts are defined with `@font-face` in CSS and loaded on-demand
3. Next.js handles static asset serving with proper Content-Type headers as configured in `next.config.ts`
4. Vercel routes are simplified to avoid conflicts with Next.js asset handling
5. Browser caching is optimized with appropriate cache headers
6. Security is enhanced with proper Content Security Policy headers

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Open the browser developer tools
3. Check the Console tab for any remaining warnings
4. Check the Network tab to verify:
   - Fonts are loaded correctly
   - CSS files are served with `text/css` MIME type
   - JavaScript files are served with `application/javascript` MIME type
   - All assets load without MIME type errors
5. Verify that the application functions correctly after deployment

## Future Considerations

1. Monitor font loading performance to ensure no regressions
2. Consider implementing font loading strategies for critical fonts
3. Regularly audit static assets for similar issues
4. Test the application across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior
5. Monitor Vercel analytics for any performance regressions after deployment
6. Keep Next.js and Vercel configurations updated with best practices
