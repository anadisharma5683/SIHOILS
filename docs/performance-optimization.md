# Performance Optimization Fixes

This document explains the changes made to resolve browser console warnings related to font preloading and CSS MIME types.

## Issues Identified

1. **Font Preload Warnings**: 
   - The browser was showing warnings about preloaded WOFF2 font resources not being used within a few seconds
   - Example: `The resource https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/media/caa3a2e1cccd8315-s.p.853070df.woff2 was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event.`

2. **CSS MIME Type Error**:
   - Error: `Refused to apply style from 'https://sihoils.vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/c8d63484c312b3bd.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Font Preload Optimization

**Changes made in `src/app/layout.tsx`**:
- Disabled automatic font preloading by setting `preload: false` for both Geist fonts
- This prevents Next.js from automatically injecting preload links for fonts that may not be immediately used

**Changes made in `src/app/globals.css`**:
- Added custom `@font-face` definitions for Geist and Geist Mono fonts
- Fonts are now loaded via local files in the `public/fonts` directory
- Added `font-display: swap` for better loading performance

**Changes made in `public/fonts/`**:
- Created a dedicated directory for font files
- Copied actual WOFF2 font files from the build output to this directory
- Added a README.md to explain the font handling approach

### 2. MIME Type Fix

**Changes made in `next.config.ts`**:
- Removed any potentially conflicting header configurations for static files
- Kept only essential cache control headers

**Changes made in `vercel.json`**:
- Added explicit MIME type headers for different static file types:
  - CSS files: `text/css`
  - JavaScript files: `application/javascript`
  - Font files: `font/woff2`
- This ensures that Vercel serves files with the correct Content-Type headers

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Console Warnings**: No more preload warnings or MIME type errors
2. **Better Performance**: Fonts are loaded more efficiently with proper caching
3. **Improved User Experience**: Faster rendering with font-display swap
4. **Reduced Bandwidth**: Only fonts that are actually used will be loaded

## How It Works

1. Next.js no longer automatically preloads Google Fonts
2. Fonts are defined with `@font-face` in CSS and loaded on-demand
3. Vercel serves static files with correct MIME types
4. Browser caching is optimized with appropriate cache headers

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Open the browser developer tools
3. Check the Console tab for any remaining warnings
4. Check the Network tab to verify fonts are loaded correctly
5. Verify that CSS files are served with `text/css` MIME type

## Future Considerations

1. Monitor font loading performance to ensure no regressions
2. Consider implementing font loading strategies for critical fonts
3. Regularly audit static assets for similar issues
