    title: "What is Hedging in Agriculture?",
    content: "Hedging is a risk management strategy used by farmers to protect against price volatility in agricultural markets. By entering into forward contracts or futures contracts, farmers can lock in prices for their crops before harvest, ensuring a predictable income regardless of market fluctuations. This helps farmers plan their finances better and reduces the stress of uncertain market conditions.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Protects against price drops during harvest season",
      "Provides financial certainty for planning and budgeting",
      "Reduces dependency on spot market prices"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "How Do Forward Contracts Work?",
    content: "A forward contract is an agreement between a farmer and a buyer to sell a specified quantity of crop at a predetermined price on a future date. Forward contracts differ from spot market sales because they are made before the crop is harvested. This arrangement helps farmers secure buyers and prices in advance, reducing the risk of price crashes when supply is high.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Legally binding agreement between farmer and buyer",
      "Price and delivery date are fixed in advance",
      "Can be customized to suit both parties' needs"
    ]
  },

    title: "What is Blockchain and How Does it Help Farmers?",
    content: "Blockchain is a digital ledger technology that records transactions securely, transparently, and in a tamper-proof manner. Blockchain benefits farmers by tracking the journey of products from farm to consumer, ensuring fair pricing through transparent records, and enabling smart contracts that execute payments automatically when delivery conditions are met. This technology helps reduce disputes and builds trust in agricultural supply chains.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Creates immutable records of all transactions",
      "Increases transparency and trust in the supply chain",
      "Enables automatic payment through smart contracts"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "What are the Risks of Not Hedging?",
    content: "Without hedging, farmers are exposed to significant price drops at harvest time, which can lead to selling crops at a loss, financial instability, debt accumulation, and difficulty in planning for future seasons. Historical data shows crop prices can fluctuate by 30-50% within a single season.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Exposure to severe price drops at harvest",
      "Difficulty in financial planning and cash flow management",
      "Risk of selling below production costs"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "What is a Smart Contract in Agriculture?",
    content: "A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement where terms are written into computer code. In agriculture, a smart contract can automatically release payment to a farmer's account when the agreed quantity and quality of crops are delivered. This process eliminates paperwork, delays, and disputes. Integration with IoT devices for quality verification and GPS for delivery confirmation enhances the process's efficiency and trustworthiness.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Automatic execution when conditions are met",
      "Eliminates payment delays and disputes",
      "Can integrate with IoT for automated verification"
    ]

    title: "Are There Any Downsides to Hedging?",
    content: "While hedging provides protection, it may result in farmers missing out on higher prices if the market moves favorably after signing a contract. For example, if a farmer locks in at ₹2000 per quintal and market prices rise to ₹2500 at harvest, the farmer will still receive only ₹2000. Some platforms offer flexible contracts that allow partial participation in price increases while still providing downside protection.",
    keyPoints: [
      "May miss potential price increases after contract signing",
      "Requires commitment to specific buyer and delivery terms",
      "Flexible contracts can balance protection and upside potential"
    ]
  },

    id: 7,
    title: "How Do I Get Started with Hedging?",
    content: "Getting started is simpler than most farmers think. Steps include researching platforms or cooperatives, registering with farm details and expected production, and reviewing available contracts. It emphasizes starting small and seeking guidance from educational support or local representatives.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Research and register on reliable hedging platforms",
      "Start with a small portion of your expected production",
      "Seek guidance from platform representatives or experienced farmers"
    ]
  },

    id: 8,
    title: "What is a Futures Contract in Agriculture?",
    content: "A futures contract is a standardized agreement traded on an exchange where a farmer commits to selling a specific quantity of a crop at a fixed price on a future date. Unlike forward contracts, futures are regulated and offer more liquidity. They help farmers hedge against price fluctuations while allowing for easier exit or transfer of the contract.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Traded on formal exchanges with standardized terms",
      "Offers price protection and market flexibility",
      "Requires margin deposits and understanding of market dynamics"
    ]
  },

    title: "What is Crop Insurance and How Does it Help?",
    content: "Crop insurance is a financial tool that protects farmers against losses due to natural disasters, pests, or poor yields. It complements hedging by covering production risks rather than price risks. Farmers pay a premium and receive compensation if their yield falls below a certain threshold.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Covers losses due to weather, pests, or disease",
      "Helps stabilize income even with poor harvests",
      "Often subsidized by government schemes"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    title: "What are Options Contracts in Agriculture?",
    content: "An options contract gives a farmer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a crop at a predetermined price. This allows farmers to benefit from price increases while still having downside protection. Options require a premium payment and are more flexible than fixed-price contracts.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Provides price protection with upside potential",
      "Requires payment of a premium",
      "Useful for farmers who want flexibility in volatile markets"
    ]

    title: "What is a Commodity Exchange?",
    content: "A commodity exchange is a marketplace where agricultural products like wheat, cotton, and soybeans are traded. Farmers, traders, and buyers use these platforms to hedge, speculate, or buy physical goods. Exchanges ensure transparency and fair pricing through regulated systems.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Centralized platform for trading agricultural goods",
      "Supports futures and options contracts",
      "Promotes price discovery and market efficiency"
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    title: "What is Price Discovery in Agriculture?",
    content: "Price discovery is the process of determining the market price of a commodity based on supply and demand. It occurs through trading activity on exchanges or local markets. Accurate price discovery helps farmers make informed decisions about selling, storing, or hedging their crops.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Reflects real-time market conditions",
      "Helps farmers decide when and how to sell",
      "Influenced by global trends, weather, and demand"
    ]
  },

    id: 13,
    title: "What is a Cooperative Hedging Model?",
    content: "In a cooperative hedging model, farmers pool their crops and negotiate contracts collectively. This increases bargaining power and reduces individual risk. Cooperatives may also provide education, digital tools, and access to better platforms.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Farmers hedge together for better terms",
      "Reduces individual exposure to market risks",
      "Encourages community-based financial planning"
    ]
